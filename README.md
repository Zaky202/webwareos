**WebwareOS** is a web-based operating system built with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to create a fully functional system that can be run on a hosting platform or your personal computer. With WebwareOS, you can upload and manage files and perform various other tasks typically associated with an operating system.
## Download

To download and set up WebwareOS, follow these steps:

- Download the zip file from the project's GitHub repository.
- Extract the files to a location on your computer.
- Ignore any folders except `src`, because everything we need is in it
- Run the `set_admin.py` script to change the default username and password

By default, the username is `admin` and the password is `iamtheadmin123`.
- Upload all the files to your hosting platform or run them via XAMPP or Apache from your personal computer.
- Once you have completed the setup process, you can start uploading your files and using WebwareOS.
